- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rmeza09
I am a Graduate Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Maryland.
I am looking to improve my python coding skills and post my progress here as I go.
I will include useful MATLAB code which I write for my Mechanical Engineering M.S. along the way.

Focused on signal processing through MATLAB and Python to build out software functionality for an FBG sensor network thesis.
